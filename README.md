## Purpose:
Overall App:
An app that allows the user to list their favorite alcoholic / non-alcoholic drinks!

Models:
#1 The first model is a standard post and its functionality is for the user to input a drink name, image, and check off a checkbox if the drink is alcoholic or not.



### Approach & Best Practices :
Wireframed concept beforehand, watched wiki videos from previous lectures, created a schedule, made commits everyday, reached out to outside sources ( Aegean ) when necessary.


### Issues :
Had a few outside circumstances that could not be avoided during this project ( ER visit ). Managed to do minimal styling, will come back to that in the near future for practice.

* Clone repo onto local desktop  
* npm install express, ejs, nodemon, mongoose, etc.
* run ```nodemon```  
* Open second terminal tab and run ```mongod --dbpath ~/data/db```
